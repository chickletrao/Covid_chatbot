Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).[10] It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in an ongoing pandemic.[11][12] As of 28 May 2020, more than 5.69 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 355,000 deaths. More than 2.34 million people have recovered.[9]

Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell and taste.[6][7][13] While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) likely precipitated by a cytokine storm,[14] multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots.[15][16][17] The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days.[6][18]

The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact,[a] most often via small droplets produced by coughing,[b] sneezing, and talking.[7][19][21] The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than travelling through air over long distances.[7] Less commonly, people may become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face.[7][19] It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who do not show symptoms.[7][19] The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.[22] Chest CT imaging may also be helpful for diagnosis in individuals where there is a high suspicion of infection based on symptoms and risk factors; however, guidelines do not recommend using CT imaging for routine screening.[23][24]

Recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, maintaining physical distance from others (especially from those with symptoms), quarantine (especially for those with symptoms), covering coughs, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face.[8][25][26] In addition, the use of a face covering is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.[27][28] Recommendations for face covering use by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending for them, some recommending against them (to conserve masks for healthcare workers), and others requiring their use.[28][29][30] There is limited evidence for or against the use of masks (medical or other) in healthy individuals in the wider community.[7]

According to the World Health Organization, there are no available vaccines nor specific antiviral treatments for COVID-19.[7] On 1 May 2020, the United States gave emergency use authorization to the antiviral remdesivir for people hospitalized with severe COVID‑19.[31] Management involves the treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.[32] The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID‑19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)[33][34] on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020.[12] Local transmission of the disease has occurred in most countries across all six WHO regions.[35]
Fever is the most common symptom, although some older people and those with other health problems experience fever later in the disease.[5][36][unreliable medical source?] In one study, 44% of people had fever when they presented to the hospital, while 89% went on to develop fever at some point during their hospitalization.[5][37] A lack of fever does not verify someone is disease free.

Other common symptoms include cough, loss of appetite, fatigue, shortness of breath, sputum production, and muscle and joint pains.[1][5][6][38] Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea have been observed in varying percentages.[39][40][41] Less common symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, sore throat, and skin lesions.[42] Some cases in China initially presented with only chest tightness and palpitations.[43] A decreased sense of smell or disturbances in taste may occur.[44][45] Loss of smell was a presenting symptom in 30% of confirmed cases in South Korea.[13][46]

As is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment a person is first infected and the time he or she develops symptoms. This is called the incubation period. The average incubation period for COVID‑19 is five to six days but commonly ranges from one to 14 days,[7][47] with approximately 10% of cases exceeding that time.[48][49][50]

A minority of cases do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time.[51][52] These asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested, and their role in transmission is not yet fully known.[53][54] However, preliminary evidence suggests they may contribute to the spread of the disease.[55]

Complications
Complications may include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death.[11][15][56][57] Cardiovascular complications may include heart failure, arrhythmias, heart inflammation, and blood clots.[58] Approximately 20-30% of people who present with COVID‑19 have elevated liver enzymes reflecting liver injury.[59][60] Neurologic manifestations include seizure, stroke, encephalitis, and Guillain–Barré syndrome (which includes loss of motor functions).[61] Following the infection, children may develop paediatric multisystem inflammatory
syndrome, which has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease, which can be fatal.
COVID-19 spreads mainly when people are in close contact (two metres or six feet) via small droplets produced during coughing, sneezing, or talking.[7][21] Contaminated droplets exhaled by infected people are then inhaled into the lungs, or settle on other people's faces to cause new infection.[19] The droplets are relatively heavy, usually fall to surfaces, and do not travel far through the air.[7][21] People can transmit the virus without showing symptoms, but it is unclear how often this happens.[7][19][21] One estimate of the number of those infected who are asymptomatic is 40%.[64]

People are most infectious when they show symptoms (even mild or non-specific symptoms), but may be infectious for up to two days before symptoms appear (pre-symptomatic transmission).[21] They remain infectious an estimated seven to twelve days in moderate cases and an average of two weeks in severe cases.[21]
When the contaminated droplets fall to floors or surfaces they can, though less commonly, remain infectious if people touch contaminated surfaces and then their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.[7] On surfaces the amount of active virus decreases over time until it can no longer cause infection,[21] and surfaces are thought not to be the main way the virus spreads.[19] It is unknown what amount of virus on surfaces is required to cause infection via this method, but it can be detected for up to four hours on copper, up to one day on cardboard, and up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304).[21][65][66] Surfaces are easily decontaminated with household disinfectants which kill the virus outside the human body or on the hands.[7] Disinfectants or bleach are not a treatment for COVID‑19, and cause health problems when not used properly, such as when used inside the human body.[67]

Sputum and saliva carry large amounts of virus.[7][19][21][68] Although COVID‑19 is not a sexually transmitted infection, kissing, intimate contact, and faecal-oral routes are suspected to transmit the virus.[69][70] Some medical procedures are aerosol-generating[71] and result in the virus being transmitted more easily than normal.[7][21]

COVID‑19 is a new disease, and many of the details of its spread are still under investigation.[7][19][21] It spreads easily between people—easier than influenza but not as easily as measles.[19] Estimates of the number of people infected by one person with COVID-19 (the R0) have varied widely. The WHO's initial estimates of the R0 were 1.4-2.5 (average 1.95), however a more recent review found the basic R0 (without control measures) to be higher at 3.28 and the median R0 to be 2.79.[72]
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.[73] All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.[74] Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.[23]
SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.[75] It is thought to have an animal (zoonotic) origin. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).[42] In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in the binding domain of the S protein between the coronaviruses from pangolins and those from humans; however, whole-genome comparison to date found that at most 92% of genetic material was shared between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host.[76]
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID‑19 because the virus accesses host cells via the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.[77] The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.[78] The density of ACE2 in each tissue correlates with the severity of the disease in that tissue and some have suggested decreasing ACE2 activity might be protective,[79][80][unreliable medical source?] though another view is that increasing ACE2 using angiotensin II receptor blocker medications could be protective.[81] As the alveolar disease progresses, respiratory failure might develop and death may follow.[80][unreliable medical source?]

SARS-CoV-2 may also cause respiratory failure through affecting the brainstem as other coronaviruses have been found to invade the central nervous system (CNS). While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain.[82][83][unreliable medical source?]

The virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelium[84] as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.[85][unreliable medical source?]

The virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system.[86] An acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China,[40] and is more frequent in severe disease.[87][unreliable medical source?] Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injuries may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.[86] ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.[86][88] A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) have been found in ICU patients with COVID‑19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis.[89][unreliable medical source?][90][unreliable medical source?] Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by high D-dimer levels) are thought to play a significant role in mortality, incidences of clots leading to pulmonary embolisms, and ischaemic events within the brain have been noted as complications leading to death in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Infection appears to set off a chain of vasoconstrictive responses within the body, constriction of blood vessels within the pulmonary circulation has also been posited as a mechanism in which oxygenation decreases alongside the presentation of viral pneumonia.[91][better source needed]

Another common cause of death is complications related to the kidneys.[91][better source needed] Early reports show that up to 30% of hospitalized patients in both China and New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys, including some persons with no previous kidney problems.[92]

Autopsies of people who died of COVID‑19 have found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung.[93][unreliable medical source?]

Immunopathology
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID‑19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. Clinical laboratory findings of elevated IL-2, IL-7, IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon-γ inducible protein 10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α (MIP-1α), and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) indicative of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) suggest an underlying immunopathology.[40]

Additionally, people with COVID‑19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have classical serum biomarkers of CRS, including elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and ferritin.[94]

Systemic inflammation results in vasodilation, allowing inflammatory lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration of the lung and the heart. In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID‑19 patients.[citation needed] Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy.[93][unreliable medical source?]
The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.[96] The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).[97] The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.[22][98] Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.[99][100] Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples taken two weeks apart, and the results have little immediate value.[101] Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence so laboratories across the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.[11][102][103] As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which may detect active infections and whether a person had been infected in the past) were in development, but not yet widely used.[104][105][106] The Chinese experience with testing has shown the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.[107] The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month.
Diagnostic guidelines released by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested methods for detecting infections based upon clinical features and epidemiological risk. These involved identifying people who had at least two of the following symptoms in addition to a history of travel to Wuhan or contact with other infected people: fever, imaging features of pneumonia, normal or reduced white blood cell count, or reduced lymphocyte count.[109]

A study asked hospitalised COVID‑19 patients to cough into a sterile container, thus producing a saliva sample, and detected the virus in eleven of twelve patients using RT-PCR. This technique has the potential of being quicker than a swab and involving less risk to health care workers (collection at home or in the car).[68]

Along with laboratory testing, chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine screening.[23][24] Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution are common in early infection.[23] Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.[23][110]

In late 2019, the WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID‑19 without lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least 20 seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.[122][123][124] The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available.[122] Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged.[122] The CDC has recommended cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals.[125] The U.S. National Institutes of Health guidelines do not recommend any medication for prevention of COVID‑19, before or after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, outside the setting of a clinical trial.[126]

Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected persons with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.[127] Distancing guidelines also include that people stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.[128] There is no medication known to be effective at preventing COVID‑19.[129] After the implementation of social distancing and stay-at-home orders, many regions have been able to sustain an effective transmission rate ("Rt") of less than one, meaning the disease is in remission in those areas.[130] In a simple model {\textstyle \ln(R_{t})\approx R_{t}-1}{\textstyle \ln(R_{t})\approx R_{t}-1} needs on average over time be kept at or below zero to avoid exponential growth.[citation needed]

As a COVID-19 vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest,[131] a key part of managing COVID‑19 is trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak, known as "flattening the curve".[118] This is done by slowing the infection rate to decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for better treatment of current cases, and delaying additional cases until effective treatments or a vaccine become available.[118][121]

According to the WHO, the use of masks is recommended only if a person is coughing or sneezing or when one is taking care of someone with a suspected infection.[132] For the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) face masks "... could be considered especially when visiting busy closed spaces ..." but "... only as a complementary measure ..."[133] The U.S. CDC recommends masks in public places where 6-foot social distancing is difficult to maintain, primarily in case you yourself are asymptomatic and to prevent unknowingly spreading the infection.[134]

Several countries have recommended that healthy individuals wear face masks or cloth face coverings (like scarves or bandanas) at least in certain public settings, including China,[135] Hong Kong,[136] Spain,[137] Italy (Lombardy region),[138] Russia,[139] and the United States.[125]

Those diagnosed with COVID‑19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by the CDC to stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, wear a face mask before entering the healthcare provider's office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items.[27][140] The CDC also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one's nose, coughing or sneezing. It further recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available.[122]

For areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production. In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol. Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand antisepsis". Glycerol is added as a humectant.[141]
People are managed with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital organs.[142][143][144] The CDC recommends those who suspect they carry the virus wear a simple face mask.[27] Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the issue of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.[37][145] Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve immunity.[146] Supportive treatments may be useful in those with mild symptoms at the early stage of infection.[147]

The WHO, the Chinese National Health Commission, and the United States' National Institutes of Health have published recommendations for taking care of people who are hospitalised with COVID‑19.[126][148][149] Intensivists and pulmonologists in the U.S. have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.[150][151]
Per the World Health Organization, as of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID‑19.[7] On 1 May 2020, the United States gave emergency use authorization (not full approval) for remdesivir in people hospitalized with severe COVID‑19 after a study suggested it reduced the duration of recovery.[31][152] Researchers continue working on more effective treatments and many vaccine candidates are in development or testing phases.[citation needed]

For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen for first-line use.[153][154][155] The WHO and NIH do not oppose the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen for symptoms,[126][156] and the FDA says currently there is no evidence that NSAIDs worsen COVID‑19 symptoms.[157]

While theoretical concerns have been raised about ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, as of 19 March 2020, these are not sufficient to justify stopping these medications.[126][158][159][160] One study from 22 April found that people with COVID‑19 and hypertension had lower all-cause mortality when on these medications.[161]

Steroids, such as methylprednisolone, are not recommended unless the disease is complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome.[162][163]

The Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy recommends that tocilizumab be considered an off-label treatment option for those with COVID‑19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome. It recommends this because of its known benefit in cytokine storm caused by a specific cancer treatment, and that cytokine storm may be a significant contributor to mortality in severe COVID‑19.[14]

Medications to prevent blood clotting have been suggested for treatment,[89] and anticoagulant therapy with low molecular weight heparin appears to be associated with better outcomes in severe COVID‐19 showing signs of coagulopathy (elevated D-dimer).[164]
Precautions must be taken to minimise the risk of virus transmission, especially in healthcare settings when performing procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.[166] For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID‑19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne precautions.[167]

The CDC outlines the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic. The recommended gear is a PPE gown, respirator or facemask, eye protection, and medical gloves.[168][169]

When available, respirators (instead of face masks) are preferred.[170] N95 respirators are approved for industrial settings but the FDA has authorised the masks for use under an emergency use authorization (EUA). They are designed to protect from airborne particles like dust but effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for off-label uses.[171] When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.[172]
Most cases of COVID‑19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.[173][174] The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID‑19 related respiratory failure is being actively studied for people in the hospital, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure.[175] Whether either of these two leads to the same benefit for people who are critically ill is not known.[176] Some doctors prefer staying with invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to a high flow nasal cannula.[173]

Mechanical ventilation had been performed in 79% of critically ill people in hospital including 62% who previously received other treatment. Of these 41% died, according to one study in the United States.[177]

Severe cases are most common in older adults (those older than 60 years,[173] and especially those older than 80 years).[51] Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits a health system's capacity to handle a sudden spike in the number of COVID‑19 cases severe enough to require hospitalisation.[178] This limited capacity is a significant driver behind calls to flatten the curve.[178] One study in China found 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support of ventilation, and 1.4% died.[37] In China, approximately 30% of people in hospital with COVID‑19 are eventually admitted to ICU.[5]
The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2).[1] The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.[4][6] The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January, and a pandemic on 11 March.[7][8] As of 28 May 2020, more than 5.69 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 355,000 deaths. More than 2.34 million people have recovered from the virus.[5]

The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact,[c] most often via small droplets produced by coughing,[d] sneezing, and talking.[9][10][12] The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than travelling through air over long distances.[9] Less commonly, people may become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face.[9][10] It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who do not show symptoms.[9][10]
Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of sense of smell.[9][13][14] Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.[15] The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days.[16][17] There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.[9] Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.[18]

Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, wearing a face mask in public settings, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected.[9][19] Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures. Many places have also worked to increase testing capacity and trace contacts of infected persons.

The pandemic has caused global social and economic disruption,[20] including the largest global recession since the Great Depression.[21] It has led to the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events,[22] widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying,[23][24] and decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases.[25][26] Schools, universities, and colleges have been closed either on a nationwide or local basis in 177 countries, affecting approximately 98.6 percent of the world's student population.[27] Misinformation about the virus has spread throughout the world through both social media and the mass media,[28] and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people and against those perceived as being Chinese or as being from areas with high infection rates.[29][30][31]

December 2019, health authorities in China reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, Hubei,[319] and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.[320] On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)—7,818 cases confirmed globally, affecting 19 countries in five WHO regions.[321][322]

Several of the early cases had visited Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market[323] and so the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.[324] The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS‑CoV‑2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses,[325] pangolin coronaviruses,[326][327] and SARS-CoV.[328] The scientific consensus is that COVID-19 has a natural origin.[329][330] The probable bat-to-human infection may have been among people processing bat carcasses and guano in the production of traditional Chinese medicines.[331]

The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster.[332][333] Of the early cluster of cases reported that month, two-thirds were found to have a link with the market.[334][335][336] On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested a case traced back to 17 November 2019 (a 55-year-old from Hubei) may have been the first person infected.[337][338]

The WHO recognized the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.[339] Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan reported surging cases. The total numbers outside China quickly passed China's.[340]

Cases
Main articles: COVID-19 pandemic by country and territory and COVID-19 pandemic cases
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.[341] As of 24 May, countries that publicised their testing data have typically performed many tests equal to 2.6 percent of their population, while no country has tested samples equal to more than 17.3 percent of its population.[342] Many countries, early on, had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms.[343][344] An analysis of the early phase of the outbreak up to 23 January estimated 86 percent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these undocumented infections were the source for 79 percent of documented cases.[345] Several other studies, using a variety of methods, have estimated that numbers of infections in many countries are likely to be considerably greater than the reported cases.[346][347]

On 9 April 2020, preliminary results found that 15 percent of people tested in Gangelt, the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany, tested positive for antibodies.[348] Screening for COVID-19 in pregnant women in New York City, and blood donors in the Netherlands, has also found rates of positive antibody tests that may indicate more infections than reported.[349][350] However, such antibody surveys can be unreliable due to a selection bias in who volunteers to take the tests, and due to false positives. Some results (such as the Gangelt study) have received substantial press coverage without first passing through peer review.[351]

Analysis by age in China indicates that a relatively low proportion of cases occur in individuals under 20.[352] It is not clear whether this is because young people are less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop serious symptoms and seek medical attention and be tested.[353] A retrospective cohort study in China found that children were as likely to be infected as adults.[354] Countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have a younger age distribution of cases, relative to the wider population.[355]

Initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 in January were between 1.4 and 2.5,[356] but a subsequent analysis has concluded that it may be about 5.7 (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 3.8 to 8.9).[357] R0 can vary across populations and is not to be confused with the effective reproduction number (commonly just called R), which takes into account effects such as social distancing and herd immunity. As of mid-May 2020, the effective R is close to or below 1.0 in many countries, meaning the spread of the disease in these areas is stable or decreasing.[358]


Most people who contract COVID-19 recover. For those who do not, the time between the onset of symptoms and death usually ranges from 6 to 41 days, typically about 14 days.[364] As of 28 May 2020, approximately 355,000[5] deaths had been attributed to COVID-19. In China, as of 5 February, about 80 percent of deaths were recorded in those aged over 60, and 75 percent had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.[365]

The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.[366] The first death outside of China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines,[367] and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.[368]

Official deaths from COVID-19 generally refer to people who died after testing positive according to protocols. This may ignore deaths of people who die without testing, e.g. at home or in nursing homes.[369] Conversely, deaths of people who had underlying conditions may lead to overcounting.[370] Comparison of statistics for deaths for all causes versus the seasonal average indicates excess mortality in many countries.[371][372] In the worst affected areas, mortality has been several times higher than average. In New York City, deaths have been four times higher than average, in Paris twice as high, and in many European countries, deaths have been on average 20 to 30 percent higher than normal.[371] This excess mortality may include deaths due to strained healthcare systems and bans on elective surgery.[373]

Several measures are used to quantify mortality.[374] These numbers vary by region and over time, influenced by testing volume, healthcare system quality, treatment options, effectiveness and rapidity of government response,[375][376][377] time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics, such as age, sex, and overall health.[378] Some countries (like Belgium) include deaths from suspected cases of COVID-19, regardless of whether the person was tested, resulting in higher numbers compared to countries that include only test-confirmed cases.[379]

The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.2 percent (355,575 deaths for 5,690,182 cases) as of 28 May 2020.[5] The number varies by region.[380]

Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease. These statistics are not timebound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution. Our World in Data states that as of 25 March 2020 the IFR cannot be accurately calculated as neither the total number of cases nor the total deaths, is known.[381] In February the Institute for Disease Modeling estimated the IFR as 0.94% (95% confidence interval 0.37–2.9), based on data from China.[382][383] The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) estimated a global CFR of 0.8 to 9.6 percent (last revised 30 April) and IFR of 0.10 percent to 0.41 percent (last revised 2 May), acknowledging that this will vary between populations due to differences in demographics.[384] The CDC estimates for planning purposes that the fatality rate among those who are symptomatic is 0.4% (0.2% to 1%) and that 35% of infected individuals are asymptomatic, for an overall infection fatality rate of 0.26% (as of 20 May).[385][386]

The WHO said on 11 March 2020 the pandemic could be controlled.[8] The peak and ultimate duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ by location. Maciej Boni of Penn State University said, "Left unchecked, infectious outbreaks typically plateau and then start to decline when the disease runs out of available hosts. But it's almost impossible to make any sensible projection right now about when that will be."[389] The Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson stated that physical distancing and other measures will be required "until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more)".[390] William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said because the coronavirus is "so readily transmissible", it "might turn into a seasonal disease, making a comeback every year". The virulence of the comeback would depend on herd immunity and the extent of mutation.[391]

The usual incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset) ranges from one to 14 days, and is most commonly five days.[9][393] Some infected people have no symptoms, known as asymptomatic or presymptomatic carriers; transmission from such a carrier is considered possible.[394] As at 6 April, estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range widely from 5% to 80%.[395]

Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific; the two most common symptoms are fever (88 percent) and dry cough (68 percent). Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum production (phlegm), loss of the sense of smell, loss of taste, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, coughing out blood, diarrhea, and rash.[396][397][398]

Among those who develop symptoms, approximately one in five may become more seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.[9] Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.[14] Further development of the disease can lead to complications including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and kidney failure.[397]
COVID-19 spreads mainly when people are in close contact (two metres or six feet) via small droplets produced during coughing, sneezing, or talking.[9][12] Contaminated droplets exhaled by infected people are then inhaled into the lungs, or settle on other people's faces to cause new infection.[10] The droplets are relatively heavy, usually fall to surfaces, and do not travel far through the air.[9][12] People can transmit the virus without showing symptoms, but it is unclear how often this happens.[9][10][12] One estimate of the number of those infected who are asymptomatic is 40%.[399]

People are most infectious when they show symptoms (even mild or non-specific symptoms), but may be infectious for up to two days before symptoms appear (pre-symptomatic transmission).[12] They remain infectious an estimated seven to twelve days in moderate cases and an average of two weeks in severe cases.[12]

When the contaminated droplets fall to floors or surfaces they can, though less commonly, remain infectious if people touch contaminated surfaces and then their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.[9] On surfaces the amount of active virus decreases over time until it can no longer cause infection,[12] and surfaces are thought not to be the main way the virus spreads.[10] It is unknown what amount of virus on surfaces is required to cause infection via this method, but it can be detected for up to four hours on copper, up to one day on cardboard, and up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304).[12][400][401] Surfaces are easily decontaminated with household disinfectants which kill the virus outside the human body or on the hands.[9] Disinfectants or bleach are not a treatment for COVID‑19, and cause health problems when not used properly, such as when used inside the human body.[402]

Sputum and saliva carry large amounts of virus.[9][10][12][403] Although COVID‑19 is not a sexually transmitted infection, kissing, intimate contact, and faecal-oral routes are suspected to transmit the virus.[404][405] Some medical procedures are aerosol-generating[406] and result in the virus being transmitted more easily than normal.[9][12]

COVID‑19 is a new disease, and many of the details of its spread are still under investigation.[9][10][12] It spreads easily between people—easier than influenza but not as easily as measles.[10] Estimates of the number of people infected by one person with COVID-19 (the R0) have varied widely. The WHO's initial estimates of the R0 were 1.4-2.5 (average 1.95), however a more recent review found the basic R0 (without control measures) to be higher at 3.28 and the median R0 to be 2.79.[407]

The virus may occur in breastmilk.[408]
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.[328] All features of the novel SARS‑CoV‑2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.[409]

SARS‑CoV‑2 is closely related to SARS‑CoV, and is thought to have a zoonotic origin.[325] SARS‑CoV‑2 genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, and is 96 percent identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples[410] and 92 percent identical to pangolin coronavirus.[411]
